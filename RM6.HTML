                <h2>Bali</h2>

                    Tanah Lot Temple:  Tourist Places To Visit In BaliPhotograph by 
                    Tanah Lot is an iconic point in Indonesia. The temple is built on a rock formation off Bali island and makes for one of the seven temples around the Balinese coast dedicated to the sea. This temple is dedicated to the Balinese Sea God Dewa Baruna. Interestingly the entrance is taken over by the ocean during high tides making these gradually transforming rocks accessible only during the low tides. The myth surrounding this temple is an exotic one, that of venomous sea snakes guarding the temple entrance.

                        Mount Batur:  Tourist Places To Visit In BaliPhotograph by 
                        Of the two active volcanoes in Bali, Mount Batur erupted as recently as the year 2000. However, of late, treks to the summit of the craters have become popular with travelers planning a sunrise trek to the volcano tops. Enjoy the amazing view from the top after the sheer thrill of walking along the mouth of a fairly active volcano. Some might even enjoy boiling eggs using the heat emitted by the calderas. All in all, this trek is not to be missed if your fitness levels are up to the mark.
